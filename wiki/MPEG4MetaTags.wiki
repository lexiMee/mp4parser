#summary A few words about MPEG4 Tags

== Intoduction ==

Currently Apple has provided their own MPEG4 descriptor tags. They are not officially documented, but another open source project, called AtomicParsley, has [http://atomicparsley.sourceforge.net/mpeg-4files.html documented] what has been 'reverse engineered'.

There is indication that ID3v2 will be added ([http://www.mp4ra.org/specs.html#id3v2 see here]), but it is not clear at this point what applications have actually implemented this.
